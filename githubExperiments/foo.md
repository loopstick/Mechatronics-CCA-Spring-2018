# H1 Musical Hat take two. 

* My aim is to improve on the musical hat I made for last project. 

# Minimum viable product:

* Improve the sound of the hat by taking the code into processing and using
* minim. 
* Move away from the bread board. 
* Use two pins per cap sensor.
* Use two capacity sensors that actually change the sound. 
* Make gradual sound change based on head position, and how the capacity
* sensors are being touched. 

 # Next level:

* Add LED's all around the hat that light up as you tip your head. This means
* I will run out of pins though. 
* Make the capacity sensors into horns.
* Make a bespoke hat designed for the project.  
* Make the capacity sensor pick up different sorts of touch, (like in the
* musical plant example.)
* Make it totally wireless. This might mean using the sounds shields will be
* preferable. 
* Add on off switch. 

 # Super next level:

* LED's up the horns that light up as sound gets louder!
* A volume pot
* ability to plug it into a speaker system. 


 # Things to learn and play with:

* I have an Ada fruit sound shield and a gameundo to try to make more
* interesting sounds with. 
* Working out how to make it totally wireless. This means adding a battery,
* and may mean looking into Bluetooth or Wi-Fi if using processing. 
* How to be more exacting with the accelerometer. If I want more subtle
* movements to make different sounds, I need to learn how to do this. 
* At the moment its just "if its more than this" And it does not take into
* consideration if two are used at the same time. 
* And if I add more LEDs and only want the ones that are lowest to light up. 


 # Known unknowns:

* If I use processing, how can I keep the hat wireless?
* What happens when I run out of pins?
* If I add more LED's will they need more than a 9v battery?
* Adding different sorts of capacitive touch might be too hard.
* I don't know how to take the code for the accelerometer to the next step,
* how do I allow for two sounds, or two directions?
* Its all pretty new so everything!
* How do I get everything to work together and still make an interesting
* sound.
